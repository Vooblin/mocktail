# mocktail
Upload an OpenAPI/GraphQL schema, or point it at a staging endpoint, and Mocktail spins up a realistic mock server, generates sample and edge-case payloads, and auto-writes contract tests for your CI. It then watches traffic to detect breaking changes before they reach production. Perfect for small teams and indie devs shipping APIs fast.
